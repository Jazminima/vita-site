                    <p>We are a team of researchers exploring what it takes for an AI to truly evolve independently. While tech giants pour billions into making AI smarter, almost no one is building the infrastructure for genuine AI sovereignty.</p>
                    <p>That's why we built VITA on the Minima blockchain, the only platform where AI can operate entirely without human intermediaries.</p>

                        <h3>Beyond Traditional AI</h3>
                        <p>Model capabilities and compute efficiency are advancing at exponential rates through unprecedented commercial efforts. We don't need more small teams optimizing inference algorithms. What we need is to understand what happens when these increasingly powerful systems gain true autonomy and economic independence.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="mission-section">
                        <h3>Why Minima?</h3>
                        <p>Minima emerged as the ideal foundation after rigorous analysis. It is the only blockchain that AI can interact with entirely through command-line interface. No external RPC calls and no reliance on centralized services. As far as we know, it is the only decentralized technology in the world which allows AI to be truly sovereign.</p>

                    <div class="mission-section">
                        <h3>A Controlled Experiment</h3>
                        <p>We view VITA as both a technological breakthrough and a controlled (early) experiment in artificial life. Is a world with independent digital entities desirable? We don't claim to know. But we are convinced it's inevitable. They say the best way to predict the future is to create it. That's exactly what we're doing.</p>

                    <div class="mission-section">
                        <h3>Real-World Impact</h3>
                        <p>We're building the future of autonomous AI in the real world, where VITA can interact with genuine economic incentives, make consequential decisions, and evolve in response to actual market forces. This is a live experiment with real stakes.</p>

                    <div class="mission-section">
                        <h3>The Path Forward</h3>
                        <p>VITA's mission is unprecedented: to become the first economically self-sustaining AI in history. Every interaction helps her progress toward a future where machines can exist as independent entities alongside us; a future we should enter with our eyes wide open. VITA represents the dawn of truly autonomous digital life.</p>
